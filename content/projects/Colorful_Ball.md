You need the correct color to be able to go through the correct walls and get to the next checkpoint.

You will also get different skills that will be useful to solve the challenges.

Main features:

* On-screen joystick options to choose the size and type of movement that is most comfortable for you
* Interesting graphics, dynamic reflections on the ball (can be deactivated in the options)
* Ads can only appear when you lose so that it does not interrupt you while you advance

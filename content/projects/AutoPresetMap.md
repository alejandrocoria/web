This mod is an addon for [Journey Map](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/journeymap)  that changes the minimap preset when you change dimension. Simply press the Change Action key (**O** by default) and you can change what happens when you enter the current dimension.

The options are:

* _Nothing_ (what normally happens without the mod)
* _Preset 1_ (automatically sets preset 1)
* _Preset 2_ (automatically sets preset 2)
* _Default Action_ (what happens in any dimension that you have not configured yet)

It works on the client and is not needed on the server.

Need Journey Map 1.12.2-5.5.5.
